    <p style="width:50%">Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren’t thinking about its health

    list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the
    beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain
    cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for.</p>
